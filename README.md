Pitch: 
“Aphrodite: Fight For Love” is an action-adventure game where the player must gather allies, defeat enemies, and outrun Aphrodite in order to rescue your partner and, more importantly, live. The game opens with you and your partner on a date and they lovingly say “you are more beautiful than Aphrodite.” The goddess Aphrodite heard their remark. In anger she kidnaps your partner and is now coming to kill you to maintain her position as the most beautiful woman in the world. In order to live, you must venture to other gods' homes and realms and plead for the worth of your life. In each realm you must have to beat enemies, win over gods, and defeat Aphrodite to live and rescue with your partner.
