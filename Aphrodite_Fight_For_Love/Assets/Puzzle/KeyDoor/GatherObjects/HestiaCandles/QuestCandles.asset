  questInstructions:
  - Oh hello dear, what's a young mortal like you doing here? Are you here to take
    my place as Hestia's Emissary?
  - Hohoho I just jest. Hestia told me you were coming. And I would love to help
    you dear, but my eyes aren't what they used to be. Without Hestia's candles I
    won't know the way.
  - If you go collect all the candles and return them to me, I will take you to Hestia!
    Those candles should be strewn around these rooms somewhere...
