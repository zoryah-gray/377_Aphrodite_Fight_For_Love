  questInstructions: If you want to see the boss man, you'll have to gather all the
    keys to his office. If you can't do something that basic you don't deserve to
    see even the cusps of his crisp suit.
  questEnd: Hm I guess you're qualified...barely
  questEnded: What are you still doing here. The boss man hates to be kept waiting.
  GUIinstructions: Find the Keys Littered Throughout the Office
